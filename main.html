    <h1 style="color:white;">Life in the Future World : Science and Technology that would change the way we live</h1>
    
    <p style="color:white;">Technology has the power to do many things, and changing the world is one of them.

    We're privileged to be living in a time where science and technology can assist us, make our lives easier and rethink the ways we go about our daily lives.

    The technology we're already exposed and accustomed to has paved the way for us to innovate further, and this list of current and future technologies certainly have the potential to change our lives even more.

    Due to the increasing development in science and technology here's the  list of discoveries and technologies that will probably change our future over the coming decade and beyond:
</p>





<p style="color:white;">
        1. Colonisation of other planets and Space Tourism <br>  
        We've been wreaking havoc on Earth for a long time and the planet can only put up with mankind's destructive nature for so long.
        <br>

    </p> 

    
    <p style="color:white;">
        2.Robots in space and in the workplace <br>
        Robots can take on the more difficult, dangerous and dull jobs to save mankind the trouble and risk. They can also theoretically operate more quickly, efficiently and with fewer mistakes too. 
        <img src="ai.jpg" alt="robot" style="width:500px;height:300px;"> 
    
    </p>   
    
    
    <p style="color:white;">
        3.Self-driving and flying cars <br>
        Car batteries are lasting longer, the charging station infrastructure is growing and self-driving technology is being heavily invested in meaning it's coming sooner than you probably think. <br>
        When there's no space left on the roads, it's not unreasonable to think we might take to the skies. There are already plenty of interesting flying car designs that show this future is a realistic possibility.

    </p>


    <p style="color:white;">
        4.Hyper-fast trains <br>
        Hyper-fast trains that go underground and underwater could  not only change public transport but also international travel too. Being able to speed from one country to another would save a lot of time.

    </p>   
    

    <p style="color:white;">
        5.Gesture based computing and Wearable screens <br>
        It's reasonable to see a future where we're no longer restricted by mouse and keyboard and instead rely on voice and action to manipulate data in a virtual space. <br>
        We might be currently daydreaming of foldable phones and screens, but the future might well be screenless.There are plenty of touch-capable projector-like devices that can beam usable screens onto your skin, clothing or other surfaces. The future of smartphone tech might not even require a device in your pocket but something you wear or have implanted.

    <p style="color:white;">
        6.3D Printed Food <br>
        From creating aeroplane and vehicle parts, replacement joints such as hips, or pieces for a board game, it still has huge potential to change our lives in the coming years. <br> The materials being used to print with are evolving too, and now include graphene that is "lighter than air" but 10 times stronger than steel.

    </p>   
    

    <p style="color:white;">
        7.Recycling and re-engineering <br>
        The constant churn of new technology means landfills are often full of old and obsolete tech. One thing the human race will have to do in the future is to learn new ways to recycle, reuse and re-engineer old technology to minimise waste and save the world. People are already coming up with a variety of interesting ways to recycle old tech, including turning disused plastic into material for paving roads.

    </p>   
    

    <p style="color:white;">
        8. High Rise farms <br>
        As the population of Earth continues to grow, living space also shrinks, not only for human beings but for the animals and plants we rely on too. It's reasonable to see a future where tech will need to be developed to allow for farmland in unusual places. This concept of high-rise farms in the middle of a city isn't totally out of this world.

    <p style="color:white;">
        9.Artificial Intelligence <br>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence. Artificial intelligence is impacting the future of virtually every industry and every human being. AI has acted as the main driver of big data and robotics and it will continue to act as a technological innovator for the future.

    <p style="color:white;">
        10.Nanobots  <br>
        Other robotic technology is being employed to monitor and care for our health. Tiny microscopic Nanobots could theoretically be deployed to scan and monitor our insides to hunt out health problems.They might also be used to repair damaged organs or carry out intricate and delicate surgery procedures and remove the need for invasive traditional surgery. This could mean less time in recovery.
